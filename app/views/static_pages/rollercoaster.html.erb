    <p>
		At least once a day I'm asked, "How's work?"
	</p>
	<p>
		I typically respond, "Good."
	</p>
	<p>
		But honestly, leaving a 70-person startup to work on a 3-person one (without a source of income), doesn't feel good.
	</p>
	<p>
		It feels like you're riding a rollercoaster.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just got off a call with a prospective customer who loves Ventfull?
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel like the ride just finished and I can look back at how much fun I had.
	</p>
	<p>
		Screw up a conversation or finish a call with a completely unmoved prospect?
	</p>
	<p>
		I feel like I'm plummeting to the ground at a 90 degree angle.
	</p>
	<p>
		It doesn't feel good.
	</p>
	<p>
		It feels like that pit you get in your stomach when you're falling so quickly that your internal organs, surrounded by fluid, are falling less rapidly than your body. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I've never been more terrified in my life!
	</p>
