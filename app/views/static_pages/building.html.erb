    <p> I truly suck at coding.</p>

    <p> I'm not being modest, I'm just flat out horrible.</p>

    <p>
      But I keep working at it every day, and it feels really good when I make even a tiny bit of progress.
    </p>

    <p> So, I wanted to share two things, both equally painful in their realization</p>

    <p>
      The first is this blog. Hopefully you've noticed some visual changes. I built this bad boy from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it feels damn good. In terms of coding, this is the most, and I really mean it. The most simple possible thing I could've slapped together, but so what? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't follow any best practices. It took me 10x longer to build this than it should have. I'm positive I did something incredibly wrong and this will come crashing to the ground at some point in the (very) near future. But, for now. I'm proud. I taught myself how to build something, and I shared it with the world to enjoy. Bomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I'm proud to share is the <a href="http://yumsweat.herokuapp.com/">bodyweight workout routine</a> email app that I built.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this is even cooler for me. Blogging is great; it feels amazing when someone compliments me on anything that I slap down on a page. But, creating a super hacked together product to solve your own problem? Now that's sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not helping universities make it easier for students to <a href="https://www.ventfull.com/">get more engaged on campus</a>, I'm either eating, sleeping, or exercising. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning I wake up, I eat a disgusting breakfast, and find a crossfit workout to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It annoyed me that I had to go to <a href="http://crossfit.com/">crossfit</a>'s site every day, so I built an app that sends you a bodyweight work out to do every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not saving the world here, but I have built something that will add joy to the life of at least one person who lives in an 8X6 room, hated walking 20 minutes to the gym every morning, an couldn't stand searching for new workouts all the time (myself).
    </p>
    <p>
      And for that, I will pat myself on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, I'm done. I would love feedback (nasty criticism) on the bodyweight exercise app or my new blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, you can reach me on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SamDeBrule">@samdebrule</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Look forward to hearing from you!
    </p>
