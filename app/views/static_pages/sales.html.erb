  "I really love this, I just don't know if we're ready to give it a try."
</p>
<p>
  You wouldn't believe how many times per day I hear some form of that sentence.
</p>
<p>
  If you were to look at my calendar, you'd typically see 8 30-minute calls scheduled every day of the week. I spend that time getting our prototype in front of customers and asking what they think.  The goal is to get their feedback at every possible opportunity to ensure that we are building a product they actually want.
</p>
<p>
  If we can do that, our next order of business will be figuring out how to get our software in as many customers' hands as quickly as possible, so that we can grow revenues. Unfortunately, we're not there yet. And this is why Sales for an early stage startup is 10x more stressful than Sales at an established company.
</p>

<h3>Uncertainty that a market exists</h3>
<p>
  Working in Sales at a large corporation is a battle due to the sheer amount of rejection you face (more on that in a minute). 
</p>
<p>
But, at the end, of the day it's a numbers game. If I have to make 10 sales in a month to hit quota, and 10% of my calls result in sales, I know I have to make ~100 calls in a month to deliver. 
</p>
<p>
  At a startup, you initially have no idea if a market exists for the service you are trying to sell. You can send an infinite number of emails or bang out thousands of calls, and your efforts may be fruitless. 
</p>
<p>
  That's horrifying. Added to the fact that all of your efforts may be in vain, rejection is far more painful at a startup.
</p>

<h3>Biting Feedback</h3>
<p>
  "Punch me square in the face."   
</p>
<p>
  That must be what potential customers hear every time I ask for feedback. 
</p>
<p>
  You build a product that customers are clamoring in earlier conversations. Unfortunately, the tune always seems to change when you begin asking for money. They'll say how much they love the product, and that it is exactly what they need, only to follow up a few days later asking for a free trial (or claiming that the timing just isn't right).
</p>
<p>
  Forget about just hearing 'no,' and get ready to have your baby ripped to shreds. Hearing no when you're selling for a large company is trying, but it's just not as defeating as doing it for a startup. Anyone who's ever held a sales job had to learn how to handle rejection, but you can wait a month or two before you reach back out to the company.
</p>
<p>
  Startups don't have that luxury. Every time you hear no, you're that much closer to dying. You probably won't be around in a month or two to reach back out. 
</p>

<h3>Time alone with your thoughts</h3>
<p>
  Everyone hates having too many meetings.
</p>
<p>
  "Meetings are a huge interruption. They chip away at your time to get actual work done. I never even add anything." You've heard it all.
</p>
<p>
  But, meetings aren't completely evil. They actually serve an incredibly useful purpose for early stage startups. They give you the sense of accomplishment (even when nothing has been accomplished). One may view this as a drawback, but the importance of this feeling cannot be overstated.
</p>
<p>
  No matter how productive you are, in the absence of meetings, you have more time to doubt both yourself and your startup, especially when you're languishing in the <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/09/10/after-the-techcrunch-bump-life-in-the-trough-of-sorrow/">trough of sorrow</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, meetings simply don't happen as often when working on an early stage startup. If you're sitting next to your co-founders one the same couch all day, they feel too contrived to be worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
  So in this case, maybe startups should take a page out of larger companies' books. Schedule one forced meeting a day, even if it serves no purpose besides being a platform to vent. Maybe that would make Startup Sales as easy as Corporate Sales.
