<p>
  I consider myself very lucky. 
</p>
<p>
  Not just anyone gets the chance to spend 6 months doing something he loves.
</p>
<p>
  Building my own startup has been a hell of an experience, full of <a href="http://www.samdebrule.com/benefits">ups</a> and <a href="http://www.samdebrule.com/learning">downs</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Nearly every Monday morning over the past few months, I've experienced a wild bout of panic and self doubt.
</p>
<p>
  It usually revolves around not making any money and wondering if I've doomed my career to an eternity of failure and unrealized potential. 
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, I have amazing friends and family who help me snap out of it. I don't tell them how appreciative I am of their support.
</p>
<p>
  So here are a few things for which I am most thankful, in no particular order:
</p>
<p>
  Parents who have always believed in me and encouraged me to do whatever makes me happy.
</p>
<p>
  A handsome dog that licks my face and rolls over for belly rubs any (and every) time he sees me. 
</p>
<p>
  A sister who has always believed I would be successful (despite all opposing evidence).
</p>
<p>
  A girlfriend who loves me enough to stick around, even when most of my energy and time is devoted to building a startup. 
</p>
<p>
  Friends who still invite me to hang out, even though I'm usually too busy "trying to get some work done."
</p>
<p>
  Successful strangers who I have no business talking to, who are willing to chat over coffee.
</p>
<p>
  An internal motivation to work my ass off.
</p>
<p>
  A spacious apartment/office (even though the heat is broken and my feet are always frozen).
</p>
<p>
  A new friend who works harder than almost anyone I've ever met, and inspires me every day. 
</p>
<p>
  The ability to read. 
</p>
<p>
  The ability to run and be fit. 
</p>
<p>
  And to all the people who read and enjoy my blog, I'm thankful for you.
</p>
<p>
  Every time you comment on a post, or say you like what I've written, it makes me happier than you could imagine!
</p>
<p>
  I'm thankful for you all. 
</p>
